## Inspiration
Throughout our daily lives, we realized that we had various schedules for different activities such as working out, finishing homework, and __. However, we felt that having too many schedules in different locations was not as efficient as we wanted it to be. With so many things to do in life, we wanted to create a calendar that would store our various schedules in one location, so that it would be more optimal to remind ourselves of what we needed to complete. 
Whether they are a student, professional, or anyone else trying to find an efficient way to keep track of what they want to do. 
## What it does
Using the theme of optimization, we decided to make a calendar that would help the user plan their lives each day. The user has an option to choose whether to create a schedule as a student, professional, or for daily life. It features different integrations including Canvas, Workout Tracker, To-Do List, and Gmail. 
## How we built it
We built it using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We started with the main calendar page and built up from there. One of the main goals for the project was having a functional to-do list system which would be able to keep track of different goals and events for the different categories of life.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into issues with node.js and react.js in beginning and we decided to use regular javascript to speed up the process. We also had some hiccups with version management in the start but as the project went on the issues were ironed out.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that were able to build something in such a short time and if we had more time we would definitely build out more features for the calendar.
## What we learned
As we worked, we honed our skills on javascript and html. We were surprised by how similar the two were so similar. There were many user interface mechanics that we had to learn to integrate into our program. Further, we learned to work more as a team. At the start of the project, it was hard to split the roles and collaborate, but as we continued working, we efficiently distributed the jobs and ended up finishing.  
## What's next for The Calendar
We would definitely build up a backend where the items are actually being stored on a server. We would also be able to have different profiles and a gcal integration to connect google calendar and other popular email services right into our calendar platform.
